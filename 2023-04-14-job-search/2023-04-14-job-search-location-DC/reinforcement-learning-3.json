            "description": "\u2022 NOTE: This job posting is inclusive of a variety of positions within our Algorithms Engineering group. Based on your background, expertise and interests, we will route you to the appropriate team(s). *\n\nNetflix is the world's leading internet entertainment service with over 220 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and games across a... wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch videos and play games as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen.\n\nTo achieve our mission of entertaining the world, we are reinventing entertainment from end to end. We are revolutionizing how shows, movies, and games are produced, pushing technological boundaries to efficiently deliver streaming video at massive scale over the internet, and continuously improving the discovery and personalization of our offerings to our global user base using Machine Learning and data analytics.\n\nApplied Machine Learning Research at Netflix improves various aspects of our business, including personalization, recommendations, search, content understanding, messaging, targeting, new member acquisition etc. As such, our research spans many Machine Learning areas, including deep learning, search and recommender systems, causal inference, reinforcement learning and bandits, computer vision, computer graphics, natural language processing, and computational advertising.\n\nWe are looking for exceptional individuals to work full time with us as research scientists. In this role, you will conduct applied research by conceptualizing, designing, implementing, and validating potential algorithmic improvements. This includes researching and applying cutting edge machine learning algorithms, running offline experiments, and building online A/B tests to run in production systems. To be successful in this role, you need a strong machine learning background, solid software development skills, a love of learning, a passion for solving end-user problems and to collaborate well in multi-disciplinary teams. You will need to exhibit strong communication and leadership skills, an ability to set priorities, and an execution focus in a dynamic environment.\n\nWhat we are looking for:\n\u2022 A burning desire to solve real world problems at scale by applying Machine Learning\n\u2022 PhD or Masters in Computer Science, Statistics, or any of the related fields\n\u2022 5+ years of research experience with a track record of delivering quality results\n\u2022 Expertise in machine learning spanning supervised and unsupervised learning methods\n\u2022 Experience in successfully applying machine learning to real-world problems\n\u2022 Exceptional problem solving skills\n\u2022 Strong mathematical skills with knowledge of statistical methods\n\u2022 Excellent software engineering skills in languages such as Scala, Java, Python, C++ or C#\n\u2022 Great interpersonal skills\n\u2022 Strong written and verbal communication skills\n\nPreferred, but not required:\n\u2022 Experience as a technical leader\n\u2022 Experience working with cross functional teams\n\u2022 Experience in Search, Recommendations, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Graphs, Conversational Agents, and Personalization, etc\n\u2022 Experience using Deep Learning, Bandits, Probabilistic Graphical Models, or Reinforcement Learning in real world applications\n\u2022 Experience with Spark, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch\n\u2022 Experience with cloud computing platforms and large web-scale distributed systems\n\u2022 Experience in applied research in industrial settings\n\u2022 Open source contributions\n\u2022 Research publications at peer reviewed journals and conferences on relevant topics\n\nLinks:\n\u2022 Netflix Research site\n\u2022 Our culture\n\u2022 Our long term business view\nAreas:\n### Page Personalization:\n\u2022 Our team is responsible for research and development of the machine learning algorithms that create the Netflix homepage for all our over members around the world across all the devices. This is primarily focused on deciding which rows of recommendations produced by our many ranking algorithms to show, so that members can easily find something great to watch and enjoy, but also includes work on in general what all our algorithms should optimize for and how to personalize additional aspects of the user experience. There is very little processing done on the output of our algorithms, so the work we do has a large impact on how people use Netflix. This means that we take on the responsibility for understanding and predicting all of the different reasons that someone may want to visit Netflix and help them find what they need. When we do our jobs well, we help people all over the world find a bit more joy.\n\nExperience Personalization:\n\u2022 Our team works at the intersection of UX design and machine learning. We research and develop algorithms that decide which information about a movie to show to our members. For example, we are responsible for selecting the best artwork and synopsis for each show on a Netflix homepage. We also explain why a member should care about a new movie, TV show, or game. The goal is to help our members make great decisions on the next title to watch. A lot of our work involves contextual bandit algorithms including deploying models, investigating and improving state-of-the art-algorithms, and evaluation metrics. When we do our jobs well, we help people to select the best entertainment on the planet.\n\nPersonalization Rankers:\n\u2022 Our core team works on the core recommendations and personalization algorithms. These algorithms (alongside Page Personalization) are responsible for most of what\u2019s shown on the Netflix homepage (which drives 80% of what members in Netflix play).\n\nSome areas you\u2019ll be working in:- Recommender Systems and Personalization. Almost every aspect of the Netflix experience is personalized, and much of that personalization is driven by our various flavors of recommendation algorithms.\n\u2022 Causal Inference And Reinforcement Learning. As we\u2019re ever seeking to align our recommendations with what titles members love, it\u2019s important to tease apart the cause-and-effect of what we\u2019re doing. You\u2019ll work with large scale CI and RL algorithms to achieve this.\n\u2022 Large Scale Machine Learning. Netflix is available in over 190 countries, with over 200+ million members. This gives us a unique dataset to work with, but also unique challenges in how we scale our models. You\u2019ll work on cutting edge techniques to scale your models for use in our production systems.\n\nSearch and Recommendations:\n- This applied ML team is responsible for improving our member experience by innovating on algorithms for all aspects of Search and other discovery canvases where members express their entertainment needs explicitly. Such mechanisms are a primary way for our members to discover and engage with content on our service. Algorithms innovation in this area, hence is critical, as our content offerings scale and become diverse.\n- Our work is a mixture of applied research and engineering to do end-to-end machine learning i.e. from inception of an idea to its productization via online and offline experiments. We work in a highly cross-functional environment, collaborating very closely with PMs, back end and front end engineers, data scientists and engineers, UX Designers, editors, etc.\n\u2022 Typically we require experience and expertise in Applied ML, Search, Recommendations, Personalization, NLP, KG, HCI, as well as proficiency in software engineering, familiarity with distributed computing and Deep Learning frameworks.\n\nFollowing are some of our recent publications:- Augmenting Netflix Search with In-Session Adapted Recommendations - RecSys 2022\n\u2022 Query Facet Mapping and its Applications in Streaming Services: The Netflix Case Study - SIGIR 2022\n\u2022 Recommendations and Results Organization in Netflix Search, RecSys 2021\n\u2022 Improving Search Results Ranking Using a Knowledge Graph at KINN-CIMK 2021\n\u2022 Challenges in Search on Streaming Services: Netflix Case Study SIGIR 2019\n\nGrowth and Notifications:\n\u2022 Our team focuses on personalization of the end-to-end user lifecycle at Netflix.\n\u2022 For example, we work on a better personalized experience for signup (e.g. personalize the signup flow), optimize the payment experience (increase the success of a transaction going through, detect fraud), and personalize the messaging experience (when and what to send via emails, push notifications and pop-ups).\n\u2022 As Netflix shifts to commerce and ads, we also started shifting our focus to monetization such as detecting sharing and making better predictions of life-time value.\n\u2022 Functionally, we go from prototyping all the way to launching experiments and productionization. We often leverage causal inference and context bandits in a lot of our problem formulations. We care deeply about both research and scientific rigor, as well as product impact. We are looking for folk who can act both as a scientist and an engineer.\n\nNetflix focuses on Digital Entertainment. Their company has offices in Los Gatos. They have a very large team that's 5000+ employees. To date, Netflix has raised $3.102B of funding; their latest round was closed on April 2018.\n\nYou can view their website at https://www.netflix.com/in/ or find them on LinkedIn",

This enables software developers of all skill levels to build applications that run at any scale from a laptop to the data center...\n\nWe're commercializing a popular open source project called Ray - which is a framework for distributed computing as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning.\n\nOur goal is to enable organizations to accelerate the progress of AI applications out into the real world and at lower cost. Backed by Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, and Addition.\n\nAnyscale is based in San Francisco, CA.\n\nAbout the role:\n\nAnyscale is looking to hire strong individuals to develop open source machine learning libraries.\n\nThe software industry largely operates on a messy zoo of specialized distributed systems such as Spark, Horovod, and TensorFlow Serving.
