It is an ambitious vision that will require the development of products and solutions at the cutting edge of machine learning and AI. If that excites you, we'd love to chat.\n\nThe AI/ML Sequence Learning Team applies machine learning and AI methods to biological sequence (DNA, RNA, protein) data from large-scale human genetic, functional genomic and single cell experiments. Models operating directly on sequence data that can infer how variants alter protein/RNA abundance, structure and function have the potential to be transformative in drug discovery, empowering us to find new life saving medicines.\n\nWe are looking for a Senior AI/ML Engineer to help us make this vision a reality. Competitive candidates will have a track record in developing SOTA deep learning models for solving challenging real world scientific problems. You should be an outstanding scientist with in-depth knowledge in modern machine learning. You can convert vaguely described biological/drug discovery challenges into well-defined machine learning problem. You can independently execute and deliver full AI/ML driven solution from sourcing training data, design and implementing SOTA machine learning models, testing, benchmark and product driven research for model performance improvement, to shipping stable, tested, performant code and services in an agile environment.\n\nThe AI/ML team is built on the principles of ownership, accountability, continuous development, and collaboration. We hire for the long term, and we're motivated to make this a great place to work. Our leaders will be committed to your career and development from day one.\n\nWhy you?\n\nBasic Qualifications:\n\nWe are looking for professionals with these required skills to achieve our goals:\n\u2022 Graduate studies in Computer Science or Applied Math.\n\u2022 Experienced in developing deep learning models.\n\u2022 Experience with deep learning algorithms and model architectures.\n\u2022 Experience with deep learning literature and math of machine learning.\n\u2022 Experience in machine learning best practices, scalable training and deployment, model introspection and evaluation.\n\u2022 Experience in PyTorch, Tensorflow, or other deep learning frameworks.\n\u2022 Experienced in software engineering with advanced skills in python and/or C++\n\u2022 Experience with devop stacks: version control, CI/CD, containerization, etc.\n\u2022 At least one peer reviewed publication.\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\n\nIf you have the following characteristics, it would be a plus:\n\u2022 PhD in Machine Learning.\n\u2022 Knowledge in disease biology, molecular biology and biochemistry.\n\u2022 Experience with biological data (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics).\n\u2022 Peer reviewed publications in major AI conferences.\n\u2022 Experience in design, development and deployment of commercial AI/ML software.\n\u2022 Mentality of commit early and often, metrics before models, and shipping high quality production code.\n\nWhy GSK?\n\nGSK is a global biopharma company with a special purpose \u2013 to unite science, technology and talent to get ahead of disease together \u2013 so we can positively impact the health of billions of people and deliver stronger, more sustainable shareholder returns \u2013 as an organisation where people can thrive. Getting ahead means preventing disease as well as treating it, and we aim to impact the health of 2.5 billion people around the world in the next 10 years. \u200b\n\nOur success absolutely depends on our people.
