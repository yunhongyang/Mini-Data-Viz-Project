We\u2019re able to drastically reduce the amount of shrink (food waste) which in turn drives profit for retailers, lowers costs for consumers, and reduces the ecological impact of waste. We\u2019re using technology to solve a globally-relevant problem that both creates a positive environmental impact and an exciting (and potentially massive) commercial opportunity.\n\nWe are hiring a Data Scientist to join our growing Engineering and Data team. You will be spearheading projects across the organization to determine what data we collect and how, and which other sources we passively utilize to improve our day to day business processes. Your background in mathematics, statistics, and business logic will directly impact the accuracy of our forecasting, striking a fine balance between reducing customers food waste, and avoiding understocking situations. Help us solve critical problems related to the following areas: time-series analysis, demand forecasting, predictive modeling and machine learning, feature identification & pattern recognition, model segmentation & aggregation, constrained optimization.\n\nAs a Data Scientist at Shelf Engine, you will:\n\u2022 Work cross-functionally (e.g. Product, Engineering, Operations, etc) to frame problems, both mathematically and within the business context; to measure and optimize products and business processes; to identify opportunities, assess risk potentials and explain trends; to drive customer adoption and revenue growth\n\u2022 Own the end-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, deep analysis, visualization and models; presenting findings/actionable insights to internal and external stakeholders\n\u2022 Design, analyze, and run both simulated and live experiments (A/B and multivariate tests) to drive KPI improvement\n\u2022 Continuously improve the quality and accessibility of our analytical capabilities and framework as well as data reporting infrastructure\n\u2022 Assist in data requirements gathering and data validations to improve data platforms\n\nAnd we think you would make a great Data Scientist if you:\n\u2022 Have a Masters degree in a related quantitative field (Computer Science, Math, Statistics, Engineering, Physics, Economics)\n\u2022 Bring 4+ years of relevant working experience in a similar role, preferably with specific experience in the domain of time series demand or other forecasting\n\u2022 Have production-level experience with data querying languages (e.g. SQL), scripting languages (e.g. Python), and statistical/mathematical programming languages (e.g. R, Matlab)\n\u2022 Expertise with statistical analysis, applying various machine learning techniques, especially predictive modeling, to solve business problems\n\u2022 Bring a proven ability to think creatively, solve problems, learn quickly, work independently, handle ambiguity, and adapt to change in a fast-paced environment\n\u2022 Excellent written, verbal, and interpersonal communication and presentation skills",
