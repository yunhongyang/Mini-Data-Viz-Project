Past and present research in the group spans a wide range of use cases, including: automated understanding of the scientific literature; information extraction; unsupervised induction of linguistic structure and semantics from text corpora; and models of idea propagation and influence in social media.\n\nThough the Advanced Analytics group is located in SRI's San Diego office, the option exists to work in SRI's headquarters in Menlo Park, California.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nSuccessful applicants will work as part of a team to address challenging problems for commercial and government clients. We are seeking a potential NLP thought leader with experience in any or all of the following areas: computational linguistics, empirical natural language processing, text mining, computational socio-linguistics, and multi-source data processing (images, audio, video, text, etc.).\n\nCandidates for the position should have:\n\nExperience applying machine learning to real-world problems involving natural language, preferably with a publication record\n\u2022 An ability to use, adapt, and extend approaches described in the NLP literature\n\u2022 Strong computational and mathematical skills, with demonstrated programming experience\n\u2022 Excellent oral and written communication skills\n\u2022 An ability to work effectively with diverse groups of people\n\nQualifications\n\u2022 PhD (preferred) or Masters in Computer Science or a related field\n\nFounded in 1966, SRI's Artificial Intelligence Center (www.sri.com/artificial-intelligence) has been a pioneer and a major contributor to the field of AI. The Center researches the computational principles underlying intelligence in man and machines, and develops methods for building systems to solve problems, to communicate with people, and to perceive and interact with the physical world. Activities cover most major areas of AI, including natural language processing, machine learning, knowledge representation and automated reasoning, multi-agent systems, robotics, dialog-based systems, and image understanding.\n\nThe salary range is: $117,545.00-$155,744.00. Salary ranges will vary and are based on several factors, including geographic location, market competitiveness and equity amongst internal employees in similar roles. Positions may also qualify for SRI's Pay for Outstanding Performance program or the annual Performance Based Compensation program.
