            "description": "I have a dataset of Images that were created from DOCX documents. My goal is to train a deep neural network to back-engineer the original DOCX documents just from these images. The back-engineered DOCX document should look as close as possible as the Originals, including Tables, Images, Font Colors, Column Layout and so on...\n\nNext to the images I also have two different HTML representations of... the content of each image already created with two OCR systems which might also be helpful during the process.\n\nThe Task is the following\n\n1. Evaluate the different types of deep neural networks on the market and figure out which is the best for this use case.\n\n2. Evaluate if it is possible to start from some pre-trained network or if it is necessary to start from the scratch\n\n3. Choose a good framework for training the network\n\n4. Guide me through the setup of a training pipeline for the network in AWS with all necessary steps (I do not have experience here)\n\n6. It should be possible to interrupt the training process and conitune whenever new training data becomes available\n\n7. Give me some estimate how much training data and time we would need to get a good result\n\nWhat I head in mind was some kind of combination of Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and/or Transformer Networks. So one of the main challenges of the task would be to come up with an architecture that makes sense here.\n\nI have a sample training data available if you are interested. In principle I can created an infinite amount of such training samples",
