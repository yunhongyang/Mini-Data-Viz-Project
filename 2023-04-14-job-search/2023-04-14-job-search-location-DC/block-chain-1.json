This insecure method causes users to constantly lose millions in various \"hacks\", \"exploits\" and \"vulnerabilities\". These problems are solved using Cryptops where trades happen directly on the verifiable blockchain order book with transactions closing on average in under 5 seconds.\n\nSome unique benefits of the Cryptops project.\n\u2022 The most censorship resistant cryptocurrency derivatives DEX available.\n\u2022 The most secure and convenient staking model that does not involve any kind of obscure lending practices or lockups.\n\u2022 The asset token derivatives are exercisable to tokens that are pegged in value and directly transferable to real world native coins on their blockchains.\n\nFor further information, please visit the Cryptops website at: cryptops.exchange\n\nResponsibilities\n\nRaising capital, team building, and scaling the project.\n\nProviding overall strategic direction and take part in decisions on how to best advance the project such as to list the COE coin to centralized exchanges.\n\nPossessing strong understanding of the current DeFi market solutions and limitations.\n\nDeveloping and executing a plan to ensure the launch and growth of the Cryptops project.
