My goal is to train a deep neural network to back-engineer the original DOCX documents just from these images. The back-engineered DOCX document should look as close as possible as the originals, including tables, images, font colors, types, column layout and so on...\n\nNext to the images I also have two different HTML... representations of the content of each image already created with two OCR systems which might also be helpful during the process.\n\nThe Task is the following\n\n1. Evaluate the different types of deep neural networks on the market and figure out which is the best for this use case.\n\n2. Evaluate if it is possible to start from some pre-trained network or if it is necessary to start from the scratch\n\n3. Choose a good framework for training the network\n\n4. It should easily be possible to resume the training process whenever new training data comes in\n\nWhat I head in mind was some kind of combination of Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and/or Transformer Networks. So one of the main challenges of the task would be to come up with an architecture that makes sense here.\n\nThe goal is really to train a network that learns to create vaild DOCX documents and back-engineer the target documents from the training data that way. In principle a docx document is a zipped collection of XML files and binary data so it should be possible to create such output with a neural network. (You can try by renaming the a docx to .zip and then unzip it)\n\nIn the attachment you find a sample training data for one document. I can provide you with 1.5k of these documents right away to get started and can create a HUGE amount for improving the output quality later.\n\nI can also set up an environment with a GPU and common access if needed. For getting started right away, it would be ideal if you already have some GPU at hand ",
