DeFi Blockchain Co-Founder,Cryptops Exchange, Anywhere ,via LinkedIn,"Cryptops is currently looking for a Co-Founder / Chief Executive Officer to help launch a unique innovative DeFi exchange for crypto currency option derivatives using an on blockchain order book.

The Cryptops Exchange uses asset tokenization to provide an intuitive, secure and censorship resistant method for trading crypto currency option derivatives directly on blockchain. Cryptops is currently... the only decentralized exchange that uses asset tokenization to issue traditional financial derivatives directly to an on-blockchain order book.

Other decentralized derivatives exchanges require users to install web browser plugins in order to ""connect"" to a hybrid off-chain order book to place orders and make trades. This insecure method causes users to constantly lose millions in various ""hacks"", ""exploits"" and ""vulnerabilities"". These problems are solved using Cryptops where trades happen directly on the verifiable blockchain order book with transactions closing on average in under 5 seconds.

Some unique benefits of the Cryptops project.
• The most censorship resistant cryptocurrency derivatives DEX available.
• The most secure and convenient staking model that does not involve any kind of obscure lending practices or lockups.
• The asset token derivatives are exercisable to tokens that are pegged in value and directly transferable to real world native coins on their blockchains.

This is primarily focused on deciding which rows of recommendations produced by our many ranking algorithms to show, so that members can easily find something great to watch and enjoy, but also includes work on in general what all our algorithms should optimize for and how to personalize additional aspects of the user experience. There is very little processing done on the output of our algorithms, so the work we do has a large impact on how people use Netflix. This means that we take on the responsibility for understanding and predicting all of the different reasons that someone may want to visit Netflix and help them find what they need. When we do our jobs well, we help people all over the world find a bit more joy.

Experience Personalization:
• Our team works at the intersection of UX design and machine learning. We research and develop algorithms that decide which information about a movie to show to our members. For example, we are responsible for selecting the best artwork and synopsis for each show on a Netflix homepage. We also explain why a member should care about a new movie, TV show, or game. The goal is to help our members make great decisions on the next title to watch. A lot of our work involves contextual bandit algorithms including deploying models, investigating and improving state-of-the art-algorithms, and evaluation metrics. When we do our jobs well, we help people to select the best entertainment on the planet.

Personalization Rankers:
• Our core team works on the core recommendations and personalization algorithms. These algorithms (alongside Page Personalization) are responsible for most of what’s shown on the Netflix homepage (which drives 80% of what members in Netflix play).

Some areas you’ll be working in:- Recommender Systems and Personalization. Almost every aspect of the Netflix experience is personalized, and much of that personalization is driven by our various flavors of recommendation algorithms.
• Causal Inference And Reinforcement Learning. As we’re ever seeking to align our recommendations with what titles members love, it’s important to tease apart the cause-and-effect of what we’re doing. You’ll work with large scale CI and RL algorithms to achieve this.
• Large Scale Machine Learning. Netflix is available in over 190 countries, with over 200+ million members. This gives us a unique dataset to work with, but also unique challenges in how we scale our models. You’ll work on cutting edge techniques to scale your models for use in our production systems.

Search and Recommendations:
- This applied ML team is responsible for improving our member experience by innovating on algorithms for all aspects of Search and other discovery canvases where members express their entertainment needs explicitly. Such mechanisms are a primary way for our members to discover and engage with content on our service. Algorithms innovation in this area, hence is critical, as our content offerings scale and become diverse.
- Our work is a mixture of applied research and engineering to do end-to-end machine learning i.e. from inception of an idea to its productization via online and offline experiments. We work in a highly cross-functional environment, collaborating very closely with PMs, back end and front end engineers, data scientists and engineers, UX Designers, editors, etc.
• Typically we require experience and expertise in Applied ML, Search, Recommendations, Personalization, NLP, KG, HCI, as well as proficiency in software engineering, familiarity with distributed computing and Deep Learning frameworks.

Following are some of our recent publications:- Augmenting Netflix Search with In-Session Adapted Recommendations - RecSys 2022
• Query Facet Mapping and its Applications in Streaming Services: The Netflix Case Study - SIGIR 2022
• Recommendations and Results Organization in Netflix Search, RecSys 2021
• Improving Search Results Ranking Using a Knowledge Graph at KINN-CIMK 2021
• Challenges in Search on Streaming Services: Netflix Case Study SIGIR 2019

Growth and Notifications:
• Our team focuses on personalization of the end-to-end user lifecycle at Netflix.
• For example, we work on a better personalized experience for signup (e.g. personalize the signup flow), optimize the payment experience (increase the success of a transaction going through, detect fraud), and personalize the messaging experience (when and what to send via emails, push notifications and pop-ups).
• As Netflix shifts to commerce and ads, we also started shifting our focus to monetization such as detecting sharing and making better predictions of life-time value.
• Functionally, we go from prototyping all the way to launching experiments and productionization. We often leverage causal inference and context bandits in a lot of our problem formulations.

Need Consulting on Training a (DEEP) Neural Network and...,Upwork, Anywhere ,via Upwork,"I have a dataset of Images that were created from DOCX documents. My goal is to train a deep neural network to back-engineer the original DOCX documents just from these images.

Next to the images I also have two different HTML representations of... the content of each image already created with two OCR systems which might also be helpful during the process.

The Task is the following

1. Evaluate the different types of deep neural networks on the market and figure out which is the best for this use case.

2. Evaluate if it is possible to start from some pre-trained network or if it is necessary to start from the scratch

3. Choose a good framework for training the network

4. Guide me through the setup of a training pipeline for the network in AWS with all necessary steps (I do not have experience here)

6. It should be possible to interrupt the training process and conitune whenever new training data becomes available

7. Give me some estimate how much training data and time we would need to get a good result

What I head in mind was some kind of combination of Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and/or Transformer Networks. So one of the main challenges of the task would be to come up with an architecture that makes sense here.

Software Engineer (Machine Learning),Anyscale,"  San Francisco, CA   ",via Lever,"About Anyscale:

Anyscale provides a development platform intended to simplify distributed computing. This enables software developers of all skill levels to build applications that run at any scale from a laptop to the data center...

We're commercializing a popular open source project called Ray - which is a framework for distributed computing as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning.

Our goal is to enable organizations to accelerate the progress of AI applications out into the real world and at lower cost. Backed by Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, and Addition.

Anyscale is based in San Francisco, CA.

About the role:

Anyscale is looking to hire strong individuals to develop open source machine learning libraries.

The software industry largely operates on a messy zoo of specialized distributed systems such as Spark, Horovod, and TensorFlow Serving. These systems cannot easily be composed together and used as elements of a larger application. On the Machine Learning Ecosystem team at Anyscale, we are developing a rich ecosystem that will allow developers to import powerful distributed libraries and compose them together to build new applications.

Part of this work will be open source as part of Ray, which is a distributed Python execution engine as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning.

About the Libraries team:

Train a DEEP Neural Network (e.g. transformer) to back-engineer...,Upwork, Anywhere ,via Upwork,"I have a dataset of Images that were created from DOCX documents. My goal is to train a deep neural network to back-engineer the original DOCX documents just from these images. The back-engineered DOCX document should look as close as possible as the originals, including tables, images, font colors, types, column layout and so on...

Next to the images I also have two different HTML... representations of the content of each image already created with two OCR systems which might also be helpful during the process.

The Task is the following

1. Evaluate the different types of deep neural networks on the market and figure out which is the best for this use case.

2. Evaluate if it is possible to start from some pre-trained network or if it is necessary to start from the scratch

3. Choose a good framework for training the network

4. It should easily be possible to resume the training process whenever new training data comes in

What I head in mind was some kind of combination of Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and/or Transformer Networks. So one of the main challenges of the task would be to come up with an architecture that makes sense here.

The goal is really to train a network that learns to create vaild DOCX documents and back-engineer the target documents from the training data that way. In principle a docx document is a zipped collection of XML files and binary data so it should be possible to create such output with a neural network. (You can try by renaming the a docx to .zip and then unzip it)

In the attachment you find a sample training data for one document. I can provide you with 1.5k of these documents right away to get started and can create a HUGE amount for improving the output quality later.

I can also set up an environment with a GPU and common access if needed.

(Please Note: This is a 100% remote position that requires residence in the United States.)

We're looking for machine learning engineers with a background in reinforcement learning. Candidates with expertise in any of the following areas are highly desirable:
• Closing the sim2real gap
• Sparse rewards and credit assignment over long time horizons
• Offline learning
• Options learning and other hierarchical approaches
• Unsupervised exploration techniques
• Gym development (especially around complex DoD wargaming and platform simulation systems!)

As a company co-founded and led by engineers, we are focused on developer experience. We promise to minimize distractions (read: meetings) and to provide tools which maximize productivity. We are also committed to providing competitive total compensation, including profit sharing.

What You'll Do:

We are a small company, so you can expect to be an integral part of all phases of product development. Including lots and lots of flight testing. Here are a few examples of how you’ll contribute to the development of our tactical AI assistant, Scipio:
• Develop policies for tasks ranging from low-level aircraft control to high-level task assignment.
• Transition policies to a number of physical unmanned vehicles and evaluate performance in the field.
• Incorporate new aircraft/sensor models and simulation environments into our multi-fidelity hierarchical M&S framework.

There are no educational requirements. We're more interested in projects you've worked on - both on the job and on the side. So please be prepared to discuss those! The ideal candidate will have excellent Python skills and be adept in at least one ML framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.).

Application Process:

We have a two-stage interview process.

The
first stage is a screener which is a combination of technical
discussion about relevant engineering concepts as well as your past
experience. This screener is generally around 30 minutes.

After
the screener, if both sides believe it makes sense, we will provide
you with an 'offline' coding test. This test is done on your own time,
at your own pace, so you do not feel the pressure of coding live with
us watching. We want you to do your best with a clear mind and free of
interview jitters. The questions are a combination of algorithm and
system design. Once you complete the test, we'll all hop back on another
call and you will walk us through your code. We are not just looking
for the right answers, we're interested in your thought processes and
technical approach.

Research Area...

Deep Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Belief Functions, Dempster-Shafer
Theory

Description

We are seeking a highly motivated and talented PhD student to join our research team at University of
Artois - LGI2A - Decision and Information Fusion theme (DFI) - Béthune - France -
(https://www.lgi2a.univ-artois.fr/spip/en/) focused on advancing the state-of-the-art in deep neural networks using Dempster Shafer theory of evidence. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research projects and collaborate with other researchers in the field.

Subject

Deep neural networks (DNNs) refer to predictive models that exploit multiple layers of artificial neurons to compute a prediction [1,4]. In the original version, the layers are sequential and each neuron in a layer is connected with neurons in the previous layer. Many other alternative architectures have been proposed to adapt DNNs to solve specific and complex problems.

On the other hand, a theory called Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions, or theory of evidence
[15], has emerged as a rich and flexible generalization of the Bayesian probability theory, able to deal with imperfect (uncertain, imprecise, …) information. It is notably used in a growing number of applications such as classification (e.g. [2]), clustering (e.g. [3,7]) or information fusion (e.g. [5,13]).

Recent works [6,16,17] have shown the interest of enriching a DNN with an additional distance-based
Dempster Shafer layer [2] for predicting belief functions. These belief functions can be of great interest to represent a reality as faithfully as possible, for example to perform a partial classification [8], i.e. decisions in favor of a group of classes.

The main idea of this thesis is to develop such deep evidential networks in more depth by exploiting methods developed at LGI2A allowing one to consider finer knowledge about the quality [12, 14] and the dependence of information [11], or the ignorance in predictions [9,10].

Two applications are envisaged: Image analysis from drones and fish population analysis.

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together...

To solve this problem, we expanded into software and built integrated solutions to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.

EigenLabs is the team behind EigenLayer, which provides crypto economic security as a service for proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain modules, such as rollups, bridges, oracles, and Dapps. In today's blockchain ecosystem, each service is typically secured by its own token. The difficulty of bootstrapping new tokens often leads to too little capital to secure their services... sufficiently. With EigenLayer, blockchain services can rely on Ethereum for security instead of the value of their own token values. Stakers in the Ethereum proof-of-stake network can ""re-stake"" their assets with EigenLayer to secure other services and earn higher returns. Customers pay transaction fees for these strong security guarantees, making it possible for anyone to build innovative blockchain modules without large upfront capital costs.

New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to... discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.

Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.

JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL's science and engineering organizations and Caltech's academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines' languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity's core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions' results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts.

The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.

The Radar Science and Engineering section at JPL is looking for a postdoc to develop, implement, and test new algorithms to be adopted by the Observational Products for End-users using Remote sensing Analysis (OPERA) project to generate surface displacement products over North America.

The postdoc will help develop new ionosphere phase estimation and phase unwrapping algorithms to correct and improve the accuracy of remote sensing products derived from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis. The suitable candidate will also contribute to the verification of the displacement time-series algorithm over representative regions in North America covered by the OPERA displacement product.

The postdoc will contribute to:

• Develop and implement a new algorithm for correcting the ionosphere phase screen affecting InSAR time-series data using Total Electron Content maps derived from dual-frequency GNSS data.

• Test and quantify the accuracy of the newly developed algorithm on time series of C-band (e.g., Sentinel-1A/B) and L-band (e.g., NISAR) InSAR data and compare its performance with that from state-of-the-art methods (e.g., split-spectrum).

• Improve state-of-the-art phase unwrapping algorithms to reduce unwrapping errors and computational runtime for fine resolution wrapped interferograms.

• Verify the selected OPERA’s surface displacement algorithm over North America with a focus on regions affected by significant temporal decorrelation changes (e.g., areas with snowfall).

• Publish outcomes in high-impact peer-reviewed journals.

The outcome of this investigation will inform the OPERA project algorithm development team on the ionosphere phase correction algorithm to adopt for generating OPERA displacement products.

Machine Learning Engineer/Scientist,Unlearn.AI,"  Boston, MA  (+1 other)    ",via Wellfound,"We are advancing AI to power the future of medicine.

At Unlearn, our purpose is to advance artificial intelligence (AI) to eliminate trial and error in medicine. We use AI to simulate potential health outcomes for individual patients. Today, we are reimagining the randomized control trial (RCT) for the 21st century through AI-powered clinical trials or TwinRCT. A TwinRCT allows more trial... patients to receive the experimental treatment, reaches full enrollment faster and put patients first. Unlearn’s innovative work in AI today will reinvent how AI is applied in medicine tomorrow—and we have a top secret plan for how to get there. We won’t be able to achieve this mission just by applying technologies created by others; the future must be invented.

Unlearn is a technology company, not a biotech company. We use computers, not pipettes. We make and use software, we don’t discover or make drugs. We believe that AI will define the future of medicine, and we aren’t deterred by naysayers or skeptics.

We come from a variety of backgrounds ranging from machine learning to marketing—but regardless of where we come from, Unlearners share some common traits:

Unlearners are ambitious; we aren’t intimidated by big, challenging goals.

Unlearners are disciplined experimenters; we break down our big goals into smaller chunks and meet as often as necessary to track our velocity and iterate quickly.

Unlearners are gritty; we never give up, setbacks just make us try harder.

Unlearners are receptive to new ideas; in fact, we hate being stuck with the status quo.

Unlearners are storytellers; sharing information with each other and with the world is super important, too important to be boring. And, last but not least,

Unlearners are team-oriented; we put the mission first, the company second, the team third, and individuals last.

Founded in 2017 by a team of world-class machine learning scientists, we have raised venture capital from top tier investors such as Insight Partners, Radical Ventures, 8VC, DCVC, and DCVC Bio.

Data Extraction Program with OCR and Machine Learning,Upwork, Anywhere ,via Upwork,"Job: Data Extraction program with OCR and machine learning

I need help to develop a program or script that can analyze dental insurance fee schedules, determine the fee for each dental procedure, and extract that information to a simple CSV file...

The scope of the work is to develop this program and deliver it for exclusive use by my company.

Input:

Pdf files that include dental procedure codes, procedure descriptions, and corresponding fees.

Output:

CSV file with a column for the procedure codes and corresponding fees. No formatting or special characters.

Challenges:

1. Fee schedules come from numerous insurance companies with variable formatting and a lot of extraneous information, images, dates, etc.

2. Fee schedules often have to be scanned from faxed documents with no embedded text and optical imperfections. The program will have to use OCR and learning, not simple text extraction.

3. The procedure descriptions can wrap onto multiple lines and the fees do not always line up in neat columns and rows. The program will have to recognize the descriptions and correctly align the corresponding fees.

4. The fees that we want to extract are sometimes labeled ""fees"", or ""maximum allowable charges"", or ""maximum allowable fees"" or ""discounted rates"" or ""member pays"", etc.

5. The output needs to be very accurate. If that is not possible due to limitations of OCR, I want the program to output a third column with a confidence interval so that a human manually checking the data could quickly determine which values had low confidence and may need to be corrected.

I will provide a few samples here but I have about 20 total schedules that generally represent the range of formats might be encountered.
