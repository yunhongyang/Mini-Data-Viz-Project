DeFi Blockchain Co-Founder,Cryptops Exchange, Anywhere ,via LinkedIn,"Cryptops is currently looking for a Co-Founder / Chief Executive Officer to help launch a unique innovative DeFi exchange for crypto currency option derivatives using an on blockchain order book.

The Cryptops Exchange uses asset tokenization to provide an intuitive, secure and censorship resistant method for trading crypto currency option derivatives directly on blockchain. Cryptops is currently... the only decentralized exchange that uses asset tokenization to issue traditional financial derivatives directly to an on-blockchain order book.

Other decentralized derivatives exchanges require users to install web browser plugins in order to ""connect"" to a hybrid off-chain order book to place orders and make trades. This insecure method causes users to constantly lose millions in various ""hacks"", ""exploits"" and ""vulnerabilities"". These problems are solved using Cryptops where trades happen directly on the verifiable blockchain order book with transactions closing on average in under 5 seconds.

Some unique benefits of the Cryptops project.
• The most censorship resistant cryptocurrency derivatives DEX available.
• The most secure and convenient staking model that does not involve any kind of obscure lending practices or lockups.
• The asset token derivatives are exercisable to tokens that are pegged in value and directly transferable to real world native coins on their blockchains.

For further information, please visit the Cryptops website at: cryptops.exchange

As a member of the Leidos AI/ML Accelerator, they will be performing research and development, and need hands-on experience training and optimizing generative models. With those models and libraries, they will explore subjects like domain adaptation with supervised and unsupervised approaches. They will also build domain adaptive prototypes to examine the operational capabilities of bi-directional learning. They should be a self-starter while also being part of a team, collaborating and sharing discoveries and seeking feedback. They must be prepared to conduct research, document it, submit their research for publication, and present their research at conferences and other public forums.

Basic Qualifications
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Data Science or related field and 12 years experience.

Leidos has a career opening for a Senior Natural Language Processing Researcher...

We are looking for a motivated NLP researcher that wants to work on challenging problems in a variety of domains - including health, defense, intelligence, and energy – to get results that apply and go beyond the state of the art for measurably better outcomes. We apply our knowledge, capabilities, and experience to develop and deploy Trusted AI – AI that deserves to be trusted by system owners, end users, and the public – to be accurate, fair, ethical, reliable, and adaptable. We are looking for a researcher that is expert in NLP and interested in adapting new technologies to significantly transform human workflows, especially using new applications of transformer-based models.

Working at Leidos would give you the chance to do genuinely important work. But don’t just ask us. Here’s what ChatGPT has to say on the subject:

“Oh sure, working in AI research for the commercial sector is just the ultimate thrill. Who wouldn't want to spend their days building algorithms to recommend cat videos to stream and optimizing ad targeting to boost click-through rates? I mean, those are the kinds of problems that really make you feel like you're changing the world, right? On the other hand, working in AI research at a company like Leidos, you're stuck with jobs like supporting the next generation of lunar missions and building computer vision algorithms that help keep air travel safe and efficient. I mean, who cares about finding cures for cancer, delivering healthcare to veterans, or helping defend our nation? So boring. But hey, at least we can say we're using our AI skills for a greater good.”

Primary Responsibilities:
The Senior NLP Data Scientist will be customizing and creating various machine learning algorithms to operate over multi-domain data and optimizing the performance of those algorithms on the data. They will develop automation to extract and prepare features from multi-domain datasets. They will employ NLP libraries/toolkits that include transformer models like BERT and ChatGPT, as well as Stanford CoreNLP, Spacy, NLTK, Word2Vec, and Gensim.

As a member of the Leidos AI/ML Accelerator, they will be performing research and development, and need hands-on experience training and optimizing generative models. With those models and libraries, they will explore subjects like domain adaptation with supervised and unsupervised approaches. They will also build domain adaptive prototypes to examine the operational capabilities of bi-directional learning. They should be a self-starter while also being part of a team, collaborating and sharing discoveries and seeking feedback. They must be prepared to conduct research, document it, submit their research for publication, and present their research at conferences and other public forums.

Basic Qualifications:
•Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Data Science or related field and 12 years experience.
•Good understanding of machine learning algorithms, tools and platforms
•Experience in at least three of these Toolkits: NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pytorch, Keras, Genism, vow pal wabbit, Stanford CoreNLP, , etc.
•Understanding of transformers and foundation models
•Python proficiency
•Self-starter with high intellectual curiosity
•Great communication skills, able to explain language model results to a non-technical audience
•Proficient in data exploration techniques and tools
•Must be able to obtain TS/SCI with CI Poly security clearance.

Preferred Qualifications:
•Practical understanding of generative models
•Experience programming machine learning algorithms for GPUs
•Understanding of Convolutional Neural Nets
•Working knowledge of Word2Vec, NLTK, BERT, and ChatGPT
•Discernment of when and how to use machine learning regulation

BigTech

Pay Range:
Pay Range $142,350.00 - $219,000.00 - $295,650.00

Leidos has a career opening for a Senior Natural Language Processing Researcher...

We are looking for a motivated NLP researcher that wants to work on challenging problems in a variety of domains - including health, defense, intelligence, and energy – to get results that apply and go beyond the state of the art for measurably better outcomes. We apply our knowledge, capabilities, and experience to develop and deploy Trusted AI – AI that deserves to be trusted by system owners, end users, and the public – to be accurate, fair, ethical, reliable, and adaptable. We are looking for a researcher that is expert in NLP and interested in adapting new technologies to significantly transform human workflows, especially using new applications of transformer-based models.

Working at Leidos would give you the chance to do genuinely important work. But don’t just ask us. Here’s what ChatGPT has to say on the subject:

“Oh sure, working in AI research for the commercial sector is just the ultimate thrill. Who wouldn't want to spend their days building algorithms to recommend cat videos to stream and optimizing ad targeting to boost click-through rates? I mean, those are the kinds of problems that really make you feel like you're changing the world, right? On the other hand, working in AI research at a company like Leidos, you're stuck with jobs like supporting the next generation of lunar missions and building computer vision algorithms that help keep air travel safe and efficient. I mean, who cares about finding cures for cancer, delivering healthcare to veterans, or helping defend our nation? So boring. But hey, at least we can say we're using our AI skills for a greater good.”

With those models and libraries, they will explore subjects like domain adaptation with supervised and unsupervised approaches. They will also build domain adaptive prototypes to examine the operational capabilities of bi-directional learning. They should be a self-starter while also being part of a team, collaborating and sharing discoveries and seeking feedback. They must be prepared to conduct research, document it, submit their research for publication, and present their research at conferences and other public forums.

• Our core team works on the core recommendations and personalization algorithms. These algorithms (alongside Page Personalization) are responsible for most of what’s shown on the Netflix homepage (which drives 80% of what members in Netflix play).

Some areas you’ll be working in:- Recommender Systems and Personalization. Almost every aspect of the Netflix experience is personalized, and much of that personalization is driven by our various flavors of recommendation algorithms.
• Causal Inference And Reinforcement Learning. As we’re ever seeking to align our recommendations with what titles members love, it’s important to tease apart the cause-and-effect of what we’re doing. You’ll work with large scale CI and RL algorithms to achieve this.
• Large Scale Machine Learning. Netflix is available in over 190 countries, with over 200+ million members. This gives us a unique dataset to work with, but also unique challenges in how we scale our models. You’ll work on cutting edge techniques to scale your models for use in our production systems.

Search and Recommendations:
- This applied ML team is responsible for improving our member experience by innovating on algorithms for all aspects of Search and other discovery canvases where members express their entertainment needs explicitly. Such mechanisms are a primary way for our members to discover and engage with content on our service. Algorithms innovation in this area, hence is critical, as our content offerings scale and become diverse.
- Our work is a mixture of applied research and engineering to do end-to-end machine learning i.e. from inception of an idea to its productization via online and offline experiments. We work in a highly cross-functional environment, collaborating very closely with PMs, back end and front end engineers, data scientists and engineers, UX Designers, editors, etc.
• Typically we require experience and expertise in Applied ML, Search, Recommendations, Personalization, NLP, KG, HCI, as well as proficiency in software engineering, familiarity with distributed computing and Deep Learning frameworks.

Following are some of our recent publications:- Augmenting Netflix Search with In-Session Adapted Recommendations - RecSys 2022
• Query Facet Mapping and its Applications in Streaming Services: The Netflix Case Study - SIGIR 2022
• Recommendations and Results Organization in Netflix Search, RecSys 2021
• Improving Search Results Ranking Using a Knowledge Graph at KINN-CIMK 2021
• Challenges in Search on Streaming Services: Netflix Case Study SIGIR 2019

Growth and Notifications:
• Our team focuses on personalization of the end-to-end user lifecycle at Netflix.
• For example, we work on a better personalized experience for signup (e.g. personalize the signup flow), optimize the payment experience (increase the success of a transaction going through, detect fraud), and personalize the messaging experience (when and what to send via emails, push notifications and pop-ups).
• As Netflix shifts to commerce and ads, we also started shifting our focus to monetization such as detecting sharing and making better predictions of life-time value.
• Functionally, we go from prototyping all the way to launching experiments and productionization. We often leverage causal inference and context bandits in a lot of our problem formulations. We care deeply about both research and scientific rigor, as well as product impact. We are looking for folk who can act both as a scientist and an engineer.

Netflix focuses on Digital Entertainment. Their company has offices in Los Gatos. They have a very large team that's 5000+ employees. To date, Netflix has raised $3.102B of funding; their latest round was closed on April 2018.

Need Consulting on Training a (DEEP) Neural Network and...,Upwork, Anywhere ,via Upwork,"I have a dataset of Images that were created from DOCX documents. My goal is to train a deep neural network to back-engineer the original DOCX documents just from these images.

Next to the images I also have two different HTML representations of... the content of each image already created with two OCR systems which might also be helpful during the process.

The Task is the following

1. Evaluate the different types of deep neural networks on the market and figure out which is the best for this use case.

2. Evaluate if it is possible to start from some pre-trained network or if it is necessary to start from the scratch

3. Choose a good framework for training the network

4. Guide me through the setup of a training pipeline for the network in AWS with all necessary steps (I do not have experience here)

6. It should be possible to interrupt the training process and conitune whenever new training data becomes available

7. Give me some estimate how much training data and time we would need to get a good result

What I head in mind was some kind of combination of Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and/or Transformer Networks. So one of the main challenges of the task would be to come up with an architecture that makes sense here.

Areas:
### Page Personalization:
• Our team is responsible for research and development of the machine learning algorithms that create the Netflix homepage for all our over members around the world across all the devices. This is primarily focused on deciding which rows of recommendations produced by our many ranking algorithms to show, so that members can easily find something great to watch and enjoy, but also includes work on in general what all our algorithms should optimize for and how to personalize additional aspects of the user experience. There is very little processing done on the output of our algorithms, so the work we do has a large impact on how people use Netflix. This means that we take on the responsibility for understanding and predicting all of the different reasons that someone may want to visit Netflix and help them find what they need. When we do our jobs well, we help people all over the world find a bit more joy.

Experience Personalization:
• Our team works at the intersection of UX design and machine learning. We research and develop algorithms that decide which information about a movie to show to our members. For example, we are responsible for selecting the best artwork and synopsis for each show on a Netflix homepage. We also explain why a member should care about a new movie, TV show, or game. The goal is to help our members make great decisions on the next title to watch. A lot of our work involves contextual bandit algorithms including deploying models, investigating and improving state-of-the art-algorithms, and evaluation metrics. When we do our jobs well, we help people to select the best entertainment on the planet.

Personalization Rankers:
• Our core team works on the core recommendations and personalization algorithms. These algorithms (alongside Page Personalization) are responsible for most of what’s shown on the Netflix homepage (which drives 80% of what members in Netflix play).

Some areas you’ll be working in:- Recommender Systems and Personalization. Almost every aspect of the Netflix experience is personalized, and much of that personalization is driven by our various flavors of recommendation algorithms.
• Causal Inference And Reinforcement Learning. As we’re ever seeking to align our recommendations with what titles members love, it’s important to tease apart the cause-and-effect of what we’re doing. You’ll work with large scale CI and RL algorithms to achieve this.
• Large Scale Machine Learning. Netflix is available in over 190 countries, with over 200+ million members. This gives us a unique dataset to work with, but also unique challenges in how we scale our models. You’ll work on cutting edge techniques to scale your models for use in our production systems.

Search and Recommendations:
- This applied ML team is responsible for improving our member experience by innovating on algorithms for all aspects of Search and other discovery canvases where members express their entertainment needs explicitly. Such mechanisms are a primary way for our members to discover and engage with content on our service. Algorithms innovation in this area, hence is critical, as our content offerings scale and become diverse.
- Our work is a mixture of applied research and engineering to do end-to-end machine learning i.e. from inception of an idea to its productization via online and offline experiments. We work in a highly cross-functional environment, collaborating very closely with PMs, back end and front end engineers, data scientists and engineers, UX Designers, editors, etc.
• Typically we require experience and expertise in Applied ML, Search, Recommendations, Personalization, NLP, KG, HCI, as well as proficiency in software engineering, familiarity with distributed computing and Deep Learning frameworks.

Following are some of our recent publications:- Augmenting Netflix Search with In-Session Adapted Recommendations - RecSys 2022
• Query Facet Mapping and its Applications in Streaming Services: The Netflix Case Study - SIGIR 2022
• Recommendations and Results Organization in Netflix Search, RecSys 2021
• Improving Search Results Ranking Using a Knowledge Graph at KINN-CIMK 2021
• Challenges in Search on Streaming Services: Netflix Case Study SIGIR 2019

Growth and Notifications:
• Our team focuses on personalization of the end-to-end user lifecycle at Netflix.
• For example, we work on a better personalized experience for signup (e.g. personalize the signup flow), optimize the payment experience (increase the success of a transaction going through, detect fraud), and personalize the messaging experience (when and what to send via emails, push notifications and pop-ups).
• As Netflix shifts to commerce and ads, we also started shifting our focus to monetization such as detecting sharing and making better predictions of life-time value.
• Functionally, we go from prototyping all the way to launching experiments and productionization. We often leverage causal inference and context bandits in a lot of our problem formulations.

Train a DEEP Neural Network (e.g. transformer) to back-engineer...,Upwork, Anywhere ,via Upwork,"I have a dataset of Images that were created from DOCX documents. My goal is to train a deep neural network to back-engineer the original DOCX documents just from these images. The back-engineered DOCX document should look as close as possible as the originals, including tables, images, font colors, types, column layout and so on...

Next to the images I also have two different HTML... representations of the content of each image already created with two OCR systems which might also be helpful during the process.

The Task is the following

1. Evaluate the different types of deep neural networks on the market and figure out which is the best for this use case.

2. Evaluate if it is possible to start from some pre-trained network or if it is necessary to start from the scratch

3. Choose a good framework for training the network

4. It should easily be possible to resume the training process whenever new training data comes in

What I head in mind was some kind of combination of Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and/or Transformer Networks. So one of the main challenges of the task would be to come up with an architecture that makes sense here.

The goal is really to train a network that learns to create vaild DOCX documents and back-engineer the target documents from the training data that way. In principle a docx document is a zipped collection of XML files and binary data so it should be possible to create such output with a neural network. (You can try by renaming the a docx to .zip and then unzip it)

In the attachment you find a sample training data for one document. I can provide you with 1.5k of these documents right away to get started and can create a HUGE amount for improving the output quality later.

I can also set up an environment with a GPU and common access if needed. For getting started right away, it would be ideal if you already have some GPU at hand ",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,Contractor,True,1 month ago,,neural networks,"So one of the main challenges of the task would be to come up with an architecture that makes sense here,I can also set up an environment with a GPU and common access if needed,For getting started right away, it would be ideal if you already have some GPU at hand :-)","Evaluate the different types of deep neural networks on the market and figure out which is the best for this use case,It should easily be possible to resume the training process whenever new training data comes in",

• Make a big contribution across our entire product in this small, passionate team

At Shelf Engine, we’re harnessing the power of AI to provide real-time, intelligent forecasting for food retailers like grocery stores, food service, and cafes across the United States. We’re able to drastically reduce the amount of shrink (food waste) which in turn drives profit for retailers, lowers costs for consumers, and reduces the ecological impact of waste. We’re using technology to solve a globally-relevant problem that both creates a positive environmental impact and an exciting (and potentially massive) commercial opportunity.

We are hiring a Data Scientist to join our growing Engineering and Data team. You will be spearheading projects across the organization to determine what data we collect and how, and which other sources we passively utilize to improve our day to day business processes. Your background in mathematics, statistics, and business logic will directly impact the accuracy of our forecasting, striking a fine balance between reducing customers food waste, and avoiding understocking situations. Help us solve critical problems related to the following areas: time-series analysis, demand forecasting, predictive modeling and machine learning, feature identification & pattern recognition, model segmentation & aggregation, constrained optimization.

As a Data Scientist at Shelf Engine, you will:
• Work cross-functionally (e.g. Product, Engineering, Operations, etc) to frame problems, both mathematically and within the business context; to measure and optimize products and business processes; to identify opportunities, assess risk potentials and explain trends; to drive customer adoption and revenue growth
• Own the end-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, deep analysis, visualization and models; presenting findings/actionable insights to internal and external stakeholders
• Design, analyze, and run both simulated and live experiments (A/B and multivariate tests) to drive KPI improvement
• Continuously improve the quality and accessibility of our analytical capabilities and framework as well as data reporting infrastructure
• Assist in data requirements gathering and data validations to improve data platforms

And we think you would make a great Data Scientist if you:
• Have a Masters degree in a related quantitative field (Computer Science, Math, Statistics, Engineering, Physics, Economics)
• Bring 4+ years of relevant working experience in a similar role, preferably with specific experience in the domain of time series demand or other forecasting
• Have production-level experience with data querying languages (e.g. SQL), scripting languages (e.g. Python), and statistical/mathematical programming languages (e.g. R, Matlab)
• Expertise with statistical analysis, applying various machine learning techniques, especially predictive modeling, to solve business problems
• Bring a proven ability to think creatively, solve problems, learn quickly, work independently, handle ambiguity, and adapt to change in a fast-paced environment

Machine Learning Engineer: Deep Reinforcement Learning,Primordial Labs, Anywhere ,via Primordial Labs,"What We Do:

Primordial Labs is developing Scipio, a tactical AI assistant for drones that significantly reduces the cognitive load on pilots through machine learning...

Job Description:

(Please Note: This is a 100% remote position that requires residence in the United States.)

We're looking for machine learning engineers with a background in reinforcement learning. Candidates with expertise in any of the following areas are highly desirable:
• Closing the sim2real gap
• Sparse rewards and credit assignment over long time horizons
• Offline learning
• Options learning and other hierarchical approaches
• Unsupervised exploration techniques
• Gym development (especially around complex DoD wargaming and platform simulation systems!)

As a company co-founded and led by engineers, we are focused on developer experience. We promise to minimize distractions (read: meetings) and to provide tools which maximize productivity. We are also committed to providing competitive total compensation, including profit sharing.

What You'll Do:

We are a small company, so you can expect to be an integral part of all phases of product development. Including lots and lots of flight testing. Here are a few examples of how you’ll contribute to the development of our tactical AI assistant, Scipio:
• Develop policies for tasks ranging from low-level aircraft control to high-level task assignment.
• Transition policies to a number of physical unmanned vehicles and evaluate performance in the field.
• Incorporate new aircraft/sensor models and simulation environments into our multi-fidelity hierarchical M&S framework.

About You:

There are no educational requirements. We're more interested in projects you've worked on - both on the job and on the side. So please be prepared to discuss those! The ideal candidate will have excellent Python skills and be adept in at least one ML framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.).

Application Process:

We have a two-stage interview process.

The
first stage is a screener which is a combination of technical
discussion about relevant engineering concepts as well as your past
experience. This screener is generally around 30 minutes.

After
the screener, if both sides believe it makes sense, we will provide
you with an 'offline' coding test. This test is done on your own time,
at your own pace, so you do not feel the pressure of coding live with
us watching. We want you to do your best with a clear mind and free of
interview jitters. The questions are a combination of algorithm and
system design. Once you complete the test, we'll all hop back on another
call and you will walk us through your code. We are not just looking
for the right answers, we're interested in your thought processes and
technical approach.

We are committed to a low-stress interview experience and promise there will be no trick questions or brain teasers",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,Full-time,True,,,reinforcement learning,"Closing the sim2real gap,Sparse rewards and credit assignment over long time horizons,Offline learning,Options learning and other hierarchical approaches,Unsupervised exploration techniques,Gym development (especially around complex DoD wargaming and platform simulation systems!),There are no educational requirements,The ideal candidate will have excellent Python skills and be adept in at least one ML framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)","We are a small company, so you can expect to be an integral part of all phases of product development,Develop policies for tasks ranging from low-level aircraft control to high-level task assignment,Transition policies to a number of physical unmanned vehicles and evaluate performance in the field,Incorporate new aircraft/sensor models and simulation environments into our multi-fidelity hierarchical M&S framework",

Research Area...

Deep Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Belief Functions, Dempster-Shafer
Theory

Description

We are seeking a highly motivated and talented PhD student to join our research team at University of
Artois - LGI2A - Decision and Information Fusion theme (DFI) - Béthune - France -
(https://www.lgi2a.univ-artois.fr/spip/en/) focused on advancing the state-of-the-art in deep neural networks using Dempster Shafer theory of evidence. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research projects and collaborate with other researchers in the field.

Subject

Deep neural networks (DNNs) refer to predictive models that exploit multiple layers of artificial neurons to compute a prediction [1,4]. In the original version, the layers are sequential and each neuron in a layer is connected with neurons in the previous layer. Many other alternative architectures have been proposed to adapt DNNs to solve specific and complex problems.

On the other hand, a theory called Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions, or theory of evidence
[15], has emerged as a rich and flexible generalization of the Bayesian probability theory, able to deal with imperfect (uncertain, imprecise, …) information. It is notably used in a growing number of applications such as classification (e.g. [2]), clustering (e.g. [3,7]) or information fusion (e.g. [5,13]).

Recent works [6,16,17] have shown the interest of enriching a DNN with an additional distance-based
Dempster Shafer layer [2] for predicting belief functions. These belief functions can be of great interest to represent a reality as faithfully as possible, for example to perform a partial classification [8], i.e. decisions in favor of a group of classes.

The main idea of this thesis is to develop such deep evidential networks in more depth by exploiting methods developed at LGI2A allowing one to consider finer knowledge about the quality [12, 14] and the dependence of information [11], or the ignorance in predictions [9,10].

Two applications are envisaged: Image analysis from drones and fish population analysis.

Our company is remote-first and we consider... candidates across the United States.

Machine Learning at Curai

We are looking for a Senior ML Engineer to join the machine learning team at Curai. Our team is responsible for Curai’s ML/automation technology and drives the strategy: ML as part of the physician care team will drastically reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of providers. Your work will have a tremendous direct impact on both provider and patient-facing ML-augmented applications, thereby providing low-friction, high-quality care to patients of Curai Health.

We are primarily a text-based service and NLP is at the core of our ML work. With recent advances in large language models, we are seeing a tremendous acceleration in capabilities. A non-trivial part of our work involves appropriately leveraging and building on top of these models thoughtfully (and with scaffolding) to our use cases and backing them up with a sound automated evaluation. In addition, we use the in-house deidentified data as robust feedback data for continuously improving the ML models.

We are excellent collaborators, within our team and across teams with product owners, engineers, and clinicians to deliver automated products for doctors and patients. A successful candidate will own and help engineer end-to-end, AI/ML-powered automated systems in service of better health outcomes at lower costs.
