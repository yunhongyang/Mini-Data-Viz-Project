            "description": "Research Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers. Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the... environment.\n\nMicrosoft Research New York City (MSR NYC) is looking for an intern in reinforcement learning to collaborate with the members of the machine learning and reinforcement learning groups. We seek applicants with a demonstrated interest in machine learning, reinforcement learning, or natural language processing-related topics, and the passion and ability to craft and pursue an independent research program, including a strong publication record at top research venues. Members of the machine learning and reinforcement learning groups collaborate extensively with each other and with other groups across Microsoft.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nInterns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world\u2019s best researchers, interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides. During the 12-week internship, students are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer.\n\nQualifications\n\nRequired Qualifications\n\nIn addition to the qualifications below, you\u2019ll need to submit a minimum of two reference letters for this position. After you submit your application, a request for letters may be sent to your list of references on your behalf. Note that reference letters cannot be requested until after you have submitted your application, and furthermore, that they might not be automatically requested for all candidates. You may wish to alert your letter writers in advance, so they will be ready to submit your letter.\n\u2022 Must be currently enrolled in a master's or PhD program in Computer Science or a related STEM field.\n\nInterns are expected to be physically located in their manager\u2019s Microsoft worksite location for the duration of their internship.\n\nApplied Sciences IC2 - The base pay range for this internship is USD $5,090 - $10,120 per month. There is a different range applicable to specific work locations, within the San Francisco Bay area and New York City metropolitan area, and the base pay range for this role in those locations is USD $6,690 - $11,030 per month.\n\nApplied Sciences IC3: The base pay range for this internship is USD $6,290 - $12,170 per month. There is a different range applicable to specific work locations, within the San Francisco Bay area and New York City metropolitan area, and the base pay range for this role in those locations is USD $8,060 - $13,240 per month.\n\nBenefits/perks listed here may vary depending on the nature of employment with Microsoft and the country work location. U.S.-based interns have access to medical and vision insurance, paid sick time (accrued at 3.34 hours per pay period worked), paid federal holidays, and software discounts. Puget Sound-based interns gain access to a bus pass and a fitness club membership.\n\nOur Commitment to Pay Equity\n\nWe are committed to the principle of pay equity \u2013 paying employees equitably for substantially similar work. To learn more about pay equity and our other commitments to increase representation and strengthen our culture of inclusion, check out our annual Diversity & Inclusion Report. ( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/inside-microsoft/annual-report )\n\nUnderstanding Roles at Microsoft\n\nThe top of this page displays the role for which the base pay ranges apply \u2013 Applied Sciences IC2, Applied Sciences IC3.\n\nThe way we define roles includes two things: discipline (the type of work) and career stage (scope and complexity). The career stage has two parts \u2013 the first identifies whether the role is a manager (M), an individual contributor (IC), an admin-technician-retail (ATR) job, or an intern. The second part identifies the relative seniority of the role \u2013 a higher number (or later letter alphabetically in the case of ATR) indicates greater scope and complexity.\n\nMicrosoft is an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to age, ancestry, color, family or medical care leave, gender identity or expression, genetic information, marital status, medical condition, national origin, physical or mental disability, political affiliation, protected veteran status, race, religion, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by applicable laws, regulations and ordinances. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you need assistance and/or a reasonable accommodation due to a disability during the application or the recruiting process, please send a request via the Accommodation request form (https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/accommodationrequest) .\n\nBenefits/perks listed below may vary depending on the nature of your employment with Microsoft and the country where you work",
