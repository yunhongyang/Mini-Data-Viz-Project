We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers\u2014literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission\u2014your opportunity\u2014is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you\u2019re driven to... discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you\u2019re ready for JPL.\n\nLocated in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.\n\nJPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL's science and engineering organizations and Caltech's academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines' languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity's core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions' results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration's challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.\n\nThe Radar Science and Engineering section at JPL is looking for a postdoc to develop, implement, and test new algorithms to be adopted by the Observational Products for End-users using Remote sensing Analysis (OPERA) project to generate surface displacement products over North America.\n\nThe postdoc will help develop new ionosphere phase estimation and phase unwrapping algorithms to correct and improve the accuracy of remote sensing products derived from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis. The suitable candidate will also contribute to the verification of the displacement time-series algorithm over representative regions in North America covered by the OPERA displacement product.\n\nThe postdoc will contribute to:\n\n\u2022 Develop and implement a new algorithm for correcting the ionosphere phase screen affecting InSAR time-series data using Total Electron Content maps derived from dual-frequency GNSS data.\n\n\u2022 Test and quantify the accuracy of the newly developed algorithm on time series of C-band (e.g., Sentinel-1A/B) and L-band (e.g., NISAR) InSAR data and compare its performance with that from state-of-the-art methods (e.g., split-spectrum).\n\n\u2022 Improve state-of-the-art phase unwrapping algorithms to reduce unwrapping errors and computational runtime for fine resolution wrapped interferograms.\n\n\u2022 Verify the selected OPERA\u2019s surface displacement algorithm over North America with a focus on regions affected by significant temporal decorrelation changes (e.g., areas with snowfall).\n\n\u2022 Publish outcomes in high-impact peer-reviewed journals.\n\nThe outcome of this investigation will inform the OPERA project algorithm development team on the ionosphere phase correction algorithm to adopt for generating OPERA displacement products.\n\nQualifications:\n\nApplicants may have a PhD in:\n\n\u2022 Electrical or telecommunication engineering\n\n\u2022 Geomatics or environmental engineering\n\n\u2022 Geophysics or related field\n\nWe seek a creative and highly motivated candidate with a strong background in SAR interferometry and SAR algorithm development, particularly in the field of repeat-pass and time-series interferometry. The candidate should have excellent oral and written communication skills.\n\nThe candidate must be detail-oriented and capable of working both independently and in close collaboration with others, and should have excellent abilities in programming with Python and preferably also C++.\n\nPrior experience working with InSAR time series analysis, repeat-pass interferometry, and publication record in these fields are regarded as merits.\n\nThe appointee will be advised, and will collaborate with OPERA\u2019s algorithm development team and OPERA\u2019s project science team.\n\nApplicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoc positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.\n\nJPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique. This includes a variety of health, dental, vision, wellbeing, and retirement plans, paid time off, learning, rideshare, childcare, flexible schedule, parental leave and many more. Our focus is on work-life balance, and living healthy, fulfilling lives as we Dare Mighty Things Together. For benefits eligible positions, benefits are effective the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following the employee\u2019s start date.\n\nThe hiring range displayed below is specifically for those who will work in or reside in the location listed. In extending an offer, Jet Propulsion Laboratory considers factors including, but not limited to, the candidate\u2019s job related skills, experience, knowledge, and relevant education/training. Hiring range for this job may be adjusted based on primary work location outside of Pasadena, California. This adjusted range will be provided to candidates by the Recruiter when applicable.\n\nThe typical full time equivalent annual hiring range for this job in Pasadena, California.\n\n$82,180 - $82,180\n\nJPL is an Equal Opportunity Employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to sex, race, color, religion, national origin, citizenship, ancestry, age, marital status, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, pregnancy or perceived pregnancy, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, protected military or veteran status or any other characteristic or condition protected by Federal, state or local law.\n\nIn addition, JPL is a VEVRAA Federal Contractor.\n\nEEO is the Law.\n\nEEO is the Law Supplement\n\nPay Transparency Nondiscrimination Provision\n\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a federal facility.
