            "description": "I have a dataset of Images that were created from DOCX documents. My goal is to train a deep neural network to back-engineer the original DOCX documents just from these images. The back-engineered DOCX document should look as close as possible as the Originals, including Tables, Images, Font Colors, Column Layout and so on...\n\nNext to the images I also have two different HTML representations of... the content of each image already created with two OCR systems which might also be helpful during the process.\n\nThe Task is the following\n\n1. Evaluate the different types of deep neural networks on the market and figure out which is the best for this use case.\n\n2. Evaluate if it is possible to start from some pre-trained network or if it is necessary to start from the scratch\n\n3. Choose a good framework for training the network\n\n4. Guide me through the setup of a training pipeline for the network in AWS with all necessary steps (I do not have experience here)\n\n6. It should be possible to interrupt the training process and conitune whenever new training data becomes available\n\n7. Give me some estimate how much training data and time we would need to get a good result\n\nWhat I head in mind was some kind of combination of Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and/or Transformer Networks. So one of the main challenges of the task would be to come up with an architecture that makes sense here.\n\nI have a sample training data available if you are interested. In principle I can created an infinite amount of such training samples",

My goal is to train a deep neural network to back-engineer the original DOCX documents just from these images. The back-engineered DOCX document should look as close as possible as the originals, including tables, images, font colors, types, column layout and so on...\n\nNext to the images I also have two different HTML... representations of the content of each image already created with two OCR systems which might also be helpful during the process.\n\nThe Task is the following\n\n1. Evaluate the different types of deep neural networks on the market and figure out which is the best for this use case.\n\n2. Evaluate if it is possible to start from some pre-trained network or if it is necessary to start from the scratch\n\n3. Choose a good framework for training the network\n\n4. It should easily be possible to resume the training process whenever new training data comes in\n\nWhat I head in mind was some kind of combination of Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and/or Transformer Networks. So one of the main challenges of the task would be to come up with an architecture that makes sense here.\n\nThe goal is really to train a network that learns to create vaild DOCX documents and back-engineer the target documents from the training data that way. In principle a docx document is a zipped collection of XML files and binary data so it should be possible to create such output with a neural network. (You can try by renaming the a docx to .zip and then unzip it)\n\nIn the attachment you find a sample training data for one document. I can provide you with 1.5k of these documents right away to get started and can create a HUGE amount for improving the output quality later.\n\nI can also set up an environment with a GPU and common access if needed. For getting started right away, it would be ideal if you already have some GPU at hand ",

Want to optimize the performance of the models to take full advantage of the powerful M1 and the Bionic chips? If yes, then consider joining the CoreML team! The neural network inference team at Core ML is looking for a strong software engineer to help build and improve Apple's deep learning software libraries... Our group develops the platform used for deploying brand new artificial intelligence applications. Our team is solving key challenges in the deep learning inference software stack at Apple, to keep unlocking the power of Apple's hardware for enabling blazing fast machine learning experiences in both native and external apps. Our team's objective is to make it as easy as possible to deliver the latest deep learning technology on Apple devices in the most efficient way possible. Our work is sophisticated and highly visible. Core ML models are ubiquitous and thousands of models are already powering the smart user experiences on the iPhone, Mac and Apple Watch. You will collaborate with innovative product teams across Apple including Siri, Camera, Photos, ARKit, among others and work with them to help them efficiently deploy deep learning models on Apple devices. Key Qualifications Strong C/C+\nprogramming skills Experience with Python programming Excellent in API design, software architecture and data structures Excellent problem solving and debugging skills Experience, or deep interest, in deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX etc. Description In this role, you will work on the CoreML framework and the underlying compiler stack that powers it. You will work closely with the compiler team, including the hardware specific compiler teams for CPU, GPU and ANE. You will get an opportunity to work on different levels of the ML stack at Apple, by contributing to the core C+\nlibraries and to the python bridge connecting it to external frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. In addition, you will - Work closely with ANE/GPU/CPU hardware backends teams and the ML compiler team at Apple, to co-design features for the neural network inference stack - Design and implement new neural network ops:\nCPU C+\nimplementations and python bridge to TensorFlow/PyTorch via CoreMLTools - Design and implement new deep learning quantization features across the stack:\naffine quantization, pruning, sparsity etc - Work closely with Apple researchers and app developers to optimize their deep learning model deployments on device, by implementing new NN ops, optimizations, graph passes etc in ML stack - Design and develop APIs for common and emerging deep learning primitives:\nops, tensor operations, optimizers and more specific hardware features. Education & Experience BS/MS/PhD in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or other technical subject area is required. Proven software development industry experience (2\nyears) is also required. Additional Requirements - Any experience with modern neural network architectures and deep learning libraries - Experience with compilers, graph optimizations - Hands-on experience developing machine learning solutions - Experience in implementing optimized mathematical kernels\nSalary Range:\n$80K -- $100K\nMinimum Qualification\nSoftware DevelopmentEstimated Salary: $20 to $28 per hour based on qualifications",
