The main ways in which the simulation team realizes this include...\n\nBuilding tools that enable our software developers to perform virtual test drives instead of real ones.\n\nTesting all code changes and software releases for regressive behavior.\n\nGenerating synthetic data sets and reinforcement learning pipelines for neural network training.\n\nAs an Machine Learning Engineer at mozze, you will contribute to the development of mozze's simulation by enabling and accelerating the creation of photo realistic 3D scenes through neural rendering, neural animation, scene/object reconstruction. More broadly we are looking for experts in these fields:\n\nNeural rendering\n\nNeural animation\n\nObject reconstruction\n\nEnvironment reconstruction\n\nScenario reconstruction\n\nRequirements:\n\nExpert level Python Skills\n\nThe team operates in a production setting. An ideal candidate has strong software engineering practices and is very comfortable with Python programming, debugging/profiling, and version control.\n\nWe train neural networks on a cluster in large-scale distributed settings. An ideal candidate is very comfortable in cluster environments and understands the related computer systems concepts (CPU/GPU interactions/transfers, latency/throughput bottlenecks during training of neural networks, CUDA, pipelining/multiprocessing, etc).\n\nWe are at the cutting edge of deep learning applications. The ideal candidate has a strong understanding of the under the hood fundamentals of deep learning (layer details, backpropagation, etc). Additional requirements include the ability to read and implement related academic literature and experience in applying state of the art deep learning models to computer vision (e.g. segmentation, detection) or a closely related area (speech, NLP).\n\nExperience with PyTorch, or at least another major deep learning framework such as TensorFlow, MXNet.\n\nSome experience with data science tools including Python scripting, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, jupyter notebooks, bash scripting, Linux environment.\n\nAbout Mozee\n\nMozee is on a mission to develop the first fully autonomous vehicle fleet and the ecosystem needed to bring this technology to market. As a company at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and design, we aim to provide innovative mobility-as-a-service in urban environments. We are seeking top talent who are passionate about what we do and want to be part of a dynamic and highly-focused team.\n\nmozee focuses on Mobile, Artificial Intelligence, Transportation, Software Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning. Their company has offices in Texas. They have a small team that's between 11-50 employees.
