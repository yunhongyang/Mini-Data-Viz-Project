            "description": "Company Description\n\nSince we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn\u2019t work together...\n\nTo solve this problem, we expanded into software and built integrated solutions to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we\u2019ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.\n\nToday, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes \u2013 large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We\u2019re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.\n\nJob Description\n\nAs a Machine Learning Modeler within the Risk Machine Learning and Decision Science team, you work on projects that enable a software driven, machine learning centric view on all money movement and every transaction within the rapidly growing Square ecosystem. This touches on actively maximizing the trade off of revenue growth and risk using artificial intelligence. The machine learning driven software that we release interacts with every transaction and money movement within our seller ecosystem - a profound degree of scale and impact. Such machine learning techniques touch on transfer learning, reinforcement learning, decision theory, deep learning sequence modeling, natural language processing, and optimization theory. In addition, we also strive to provide our sellers, through seller facing products, with transparency around why our machine learning made a particular decision. This touches on algorithms in the relatively new space of explainable artificial intelligence.\n\nWe are seeking a highly motivated and experienced Senior Machine Learning Modeler to join the Payment credit risk team. The successful candidate will lead the development and maintenance of predictive models that drive our credit risk strategies, and will work closely with stakeholders to ensure optimal credit risk management. The successful candidate will play a crucial role in developing and executing the team's roadmap and long term strategy for payment credit risk modeling, and will be responsible for hands-on building and maintaining predictive ML models that drive our credit risk strategies. You are not only an executor but also a visionary leader to drive business and team growth.\n\nYou will:\n\nBuild machine learning/deep learning models for payment credit risk assessment that analyze seller / payment activity in real time / batch across Seller\u2019s ecosystem consisting of payments, banking, and debit card products.\n\u2022 Stay up-to-date with industry trends and advancements in machine learning techniques and share/lead the team for learning/improvement. Adapt existing machine learning methods and transfer learning to develop solutions that work at global scale.\n\u2022 A senior data / ML leader provides short/long term machine learning strategy, scales the scope of work and team, making recommendations that lead to e2e execution.\n\u2022 Leverage an experimentation mindset along with state-of-the-art algorithms to create preventative systems, collaborate on new product features to drive business growth and payment losses reduction, and explore new datasets (including 3rd party data) to engineer new features for our models.\n\u2022 Lead and collaborate with other data scientists, data analysts, subject matter experts, and decision makers to develop success criteria and optimize new products, features, policies, and models\n\nQualifications\n\nYou have:\n\u2022 An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.), preferably in Computer Science,Engineering, Statistics, Physics, Mathematics or a related technical field.\n\u2022 PhD plus 4 years (or Master plus 6 years) industry working experience in applied Machine learning or Deep learning\n\u2022 Familiarity with cloud computing platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP) and big data technologies (e.g., Spark) is a plus\n\u2022 A strong track record of performing machine learning model development using Python (numpy, pandas, tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-learn, etc.) and SQL/NoSQL interaction patterns.\n\u2022 Expert level knowledge of modern techniques in machine learning and deep learning, e.g., transformer network architectures, tree models with an orientation to maximizing such algorithms in a large scale production setting.\n\u2022 Familiarity with Linux/OS X command line, version control software (git), and general software development principles with a machine learning software development life-cycle orientation.\n\u2022 Machine learning strategic sequencing of methodological and software improvements to work back from maximizing core metrics associated with optimizing the business.\n\u2022 The ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences and stakeholders (PMs, Operations, Engineers).\n\nAdditional Information\n\nBlock takes a market-based approach to pay, and pay may vary depending on your location.

Experience with deep learning methods and their applications to biology.\n\u2022 ML Ops experience: model tracking and governance, multiple models in different production contexts, etc.\n\nDesirable for the role\n\u2022 A research program demonstrated by journal and conference publications in prestigious venues (with at least 1 publication as a leading author). Examples include but are not limited to: NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, JMLR, etc.\n\u2022 Deep understanding of drug development and clinical trial process and data (all phases).\n\u2022 Track record of collaborating successfully with AI engineering teams to deliver complex machine learning models.\n\nWhy AstraZeneca?\n\nAt AstraZeneca we\u2019re dedicated to being an excellent Place to Work. Where you are empowered to push the boundaries of science and unleash your ambitious spirit. There\u2019s no better place to make a difference to medicine, patients and society. An inclusive culture that champions diversity and collaboration, and always committed to lifelong learning, growth and development. We\u2019re on an exciting journey to pioneer the future of healthcare.\n\nWhy we love it\n\nIf your passion is science and you want to be part of a team that makes a bigger impact on patients\u2019 lives, then there\u2019s no better place to be.
