Your work will leverage cutting-edge learning techniques and demonstrably improve human-machine collaborative analysis for a real-life scenario.\n\nWhat you will do:\n\u2022 Work with unlabeled multimodal datasets to extract concept representations and their relationships.\n\u2022 Implement methods for learning object, property, affordance, and activity representations in a shared latent space for modality-spanning concepts.\n\u2022 Utilize the joint latent space representations to resolve inconsistencies within datasets and across modalities.\n\u2022 Correlate similar/dissimilar concepts across modalities.\n\u2022 Implement a continual learning approach that utilizes armed bandit techniques from RL to cast model retraining under data drift as a balance between exploration and exploitation.\n\u2022 Collaborate with a diverse team that includes academics and industry partners.\n\nWho you are:\n\u2022 Hold a M.S. or Ph.D. in Machine Learning or Computer Science with concentration in Machine Learning (deep learning/reinforcement learning).\n\u2022 U.S. citizen\n\u2022 Experienced in using SOTA machine learning to solve real world problems, especially in settings where rich multimodal data is involved.\n\u2022 Experienced with deep learning and optimization techniques in joint latent spaces.\n\u2022 Experienced with scientific computing packages in python such as NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn and tensor library PyTorch.\n\u2022 Familiar with unsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques.\n\u2022 Familiar with version control (Git) and collaboration tools (JIRA, Confluence, or related).\n\u2022 Capable of obtaining and maintaining a security clearance.\n\nNice to have:\n\u2022 Deep learning experience that spans the domains of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and to a more limited extent Reinforcement Learning (RL).\n\u2022 Experienced with Graph Neural Networks and graph-based analyses (e.g., relation extraction, knowledge graph creation, hierarchical ontology construction, etc).\n\nSTR is a growing technology company with locations near Boston, MA, Arlington, VA, near Dayton, OH, Palm Bay, FL, and Carlsbad, CA. We specialize in advanced research and development for defense, intelligence, and national security, trying to understand how to protect our society: from stopping malicious botnet attacks, to understanding cyber vulnerabilities, providing next generation sensors, radar, sonar, communications, and electronic warfare to developing artificial intelligence algorithms and analytics to make sense of the complexity that is exploding around us.\n\nSTR is committed to creating a collaborative learning environment that supports deep technical understanding and recognizes the contributions and achievements of all team members. Our work is challenging, but you go home at night knowing that you pushed the forefront of technology and made the world a little safer. We recognize that the world is changing, that it is becoming more connected than ever before, making things change faster than before, and reshaping society in the process. We all want to understand this changing world and leave it better for our work.\n\nSTR is not just any company. Our people, culture, and attitude along with their unique set of skills, experiences, and perspectives put us on a trajectory to change the world. We can't do it alone, though - we need fellow trailblazers. If you are one, join our team and help to keep our society safe! Visit us at www.str.us for more info.\n\nSTR is an equal opportunity employer. We are fully dedicated to hiring the most qualified candidate regardless of race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation and pregnancy), marital status, national origin, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws.\n\nIf you need a reasonable accommodation for any portion of the employment process, email us at appassist@str.us and provide your contact info.\n\nPursuant to applicable federal law and regulations, positions at STR require employees to obtain national security clearances and satisfy the requirements for compliance with export control and other applicable laws",
