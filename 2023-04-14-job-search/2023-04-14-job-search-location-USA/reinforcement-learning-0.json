Candidates with expertise in any of the following areas are highly desirable:\n\u2022 Closing the sim2real gap\n\u2022 Sparse rewards and credit assignment over long time horizons\n\u2022 Offline learning\n\u2022 Options learning and other hierarchical approaches\n\u2022 Unsupervised exploration techniques\n\u2022 Gym development (especially around complex DoD wargaming and platform simulation systems!)\n\nAs a company co-founded and led by engineers, we are focused on developer experience. We promise to minimize distractions (read: meetings) and to provide tools which maximize productivity. We are also committed to providing competitive total compensation, including profit sharing.\n\nWhat You'll Do:\n\nWe are a small company, so you can expect to be an integral part of all phases of product development. Including lots and lots of flight testing. Here are a few examples of how you\u2019ll contribute to the development of our tactical AI assistant, Scipio:\n\u2022 Develop policies for tasks ranging from low-level aircraft control to high-level task assignment.\n\u2022 Transition policies to a number of physical unmanned vehicles and evaluate performance in the field.\n\u2022 Incorporate new aircraft/sensor models and simulation environments into our multi-fidelity hierarchical M&S framework.\n\nAbout You:\n\nThere are no educational requirements. We're more interested in projects you've worked on - both on the job and on the side. So please be prepared to discuss those! The ideal candidate will have excellent Python skills and be adept in at least one ML framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.).\n\nApplication Process:\n\nWe have a two-stage interview process.\n\nThe\nfirst stage is a screener which is a combination of technical\ndiscussion about relevant engineering concepts as well as your past\nexperience. This screener is generally around 30 minutes.\n\nAfter\nthe screener, if both sides believe it makes sense, we will provide\nyou with an 'offline' coding test. This test is done on your own time,\nat your own pace, so you do not feel the pressure of coding live with\nus watching. We want you to do your best with a clear mind and free of\ninterview jitters. The questions are a combination of algorithm and\nsystem design. Once you complete the test, we'll all hop back on another\ncall and you will walk us through your code. We are not just looking\nfor the right answers, we're interested in your thought processes and\ntechnical approach.\n\nWe are committed to a low-stress interview experience and promise there will be no trick questions or brain teasers",

            "description": "Microsoft Research New York City (MSR NYC) is seeking outstanding applicants for multiple postdoctoral researcher positions in machine learning (ML) and AI, especially in the following focus areas: theoretical ML, interactive ML (including reinforcement learning and active learning), and natural language processing (including grounded language understanding and applications of RL to NLP). These... are two-year positions, starting in July 2023.\n\nFor full consideration, all application materials should be submitted by December 9, 2022.\n\nAs a postdoctoral researcher, you will have the opportunity to pursue your own research agenda while interacting with our group's diverse array of researchers and practitioners, and contributing to ongoing research projects. We collaborate extensively with groups at other MSR locations and across Microsoft. Postdoc researchers receive a competitive salary and benefits, and are eligible for relocation benefits.\n\nMicrosoft Research offers an exhilarating and supportive environment for cutting-edge, multidisciplinary research, both theoretical and empirical, with access to an extraordinary diversity of data sources, an open publications policy, and close links to top academic institutions around the world.\n\nWe are seeking candidates in the general area of machine learning, especially those with a demonstrated interest in the following focus areas: theoretical machine learning, interactive machine learning (including theoretical, applied, and empirical reinforcement learning and active learning), and natural language processing (including grounded language understanding and applications of RL to NLP). Applicants should have a well-established research track record, evidenced by conference or journal publications (or equivalent pieces of writing) and broader contributions to the research community.\n\nApplicants must have fulfilled their PhD degree requirements, including submission of their dissertation, prior to joining MSR NYC. We encourage candidates with tenure-track academic job offers to apply (with the option of doing a one-year rather than two-year postdoc), provided they are able to defer their start date by at least one year to accept our position.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, and we\u2019re dedicated to this mission across every aspect of our company. Our culture is centered on embracing a growth mindset and encouraging teams and leaders to bring their best each day. Join us and help shape the future of the world.\n\nHow to Apply\n\nTo be assured of full consideration, all application materials, including reference letters, need to be received by December 9, 2022. Applications received after that date may or may not be considered.\n\nTo ensure we receive a complete application from you, please be sure to follow these instructions:\n\u2022 Upload your CV.\n\u2022 When prompted in your application, please provide the names and contact information for at least 3 reference letter writers (in nearly all cases, one will be from your dissertation advisor).\n\u2022 Upload (as separate attachments to your application) 2 conference or journal articles, book chapters, or equivalent (potentially unpublished) writing samples that you are most proud of, and which best demonstrate your expertise.\n\u2022 Upload (as an attachment to your application) an academic statement (no more than 4 pages) that outlines both your research achievements and agenda.\n\nAfter you submit your application, the system will send a request for letters to your list of references on your behalf. Note: The application system will not request reference letters until after you have submitted your application. You may wish to alert your letter writers in advance so that they will be ready to submit your letter by our application deadline of December 9, 2022. While you will not be able to view the letters themselves, you can check the status of individual reference requests within your application",
