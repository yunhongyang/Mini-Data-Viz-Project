            "description": "We are advancing AI to power the future of medicine.\n\nAt Unlearn, our purpose is to advance artificial intelligence (AI) to eliminate trial and error in medicine. We use AI to simulate potential health outcomes for individual patients. Today, we are reimagining the randomized control trial (RCT) for the 21st century through AI-powered clinical trials or TwinRCT. A TwinRCT allows more trial... patients to receive the experimental treatment, reaches full enrollment faster and put patients first. Unlearn\u2019s innovative work in AI today will reinvent how AI is applied in medicine tomorrow\u2014and we have a top secret plan for how to get there. We won\u2019t be able to achieve this mission just by applying technologies created by others; the future must be invented.\n\nUnlearn is a technology company, not a biotech company. We use computers, not pipettes. We make and use software, we don\u2019t discover or make drugs. We believe that AI will define the future of medicine, and we aren\u2019t deterred by naysayers or skeptics.\n\nWe come from a variety of backgrounds ranging from machine learning to marketing\u2014but regardless of where we come from, Unlearners share some common traits:\n\nUnlearners are ambitious; we aren\u2019t intimidated by big, challenging goals.\n\nUnlearners are disciplined experimenters; we break down our big goals into smaller chunks and meet as often as necessary to track our velocity and iterate quickly.\n\nUnlearners are gritty; we never give up, setbacks just make us try harder.\n\nUnlearners are receptive to new ideas; in fact, we hate being stuck with the status quo.\n\nUnlearners are storytellers; sharing information with each other and with the world is super important, too important to be boring. And, last but not least,\n\nUnlearners are team-oriented; we put the mission first, the company second, the team third, and individuals last.\n\nFounded in 2017 by a team of world-class machine learning scientists, we have raised venture capital from top tier investors such as Insight Partners, Radical Ventures, 8VC, DCVC, and DCVC Bio. We completed our $50 million Series B in April 2022. We are headquartered in San Francisco, CA and have an additional office in Boston, MA.\n\nIf our purpose and culture resonate with you, we invite you to apply.\n\nMachine Learning Engineers on our modeling teams are responsible for advancing the state of the art in machine learning and applying those learnings to our products. We create digital twins of participants in clinical trials and strive to make these twins indistinguishable from real humans. In order to do this, we find that models from the literature are not enough and we need to continually invent new models for our applications. We then dive deep into our models in order to productionize them for clinical trials. You will be part of a fast-paced, multidisciplinary team that loves tackling tough problem\n\nResponsibilities\n\u2022 Inventing new machine learning techniques that are applicable for clinical trials.\n\u2022 Productionize our research and ensure we can predict disease progression that is as reliable as having a human participant in a trial.\n\u2022 Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and statisticians to ensure we are delivering the right product at the right time.\n\nRequirements\n\u2022 Track record of using machine learning to solve challenging problems.\n\u2022 3+ years in a related role\n\u2022 Fluency in Python and essential machine learning libraries (numpy, pandas, PyTorch, etc.) Demonstrated experience in collaborative software development.\n\u2022 Experience or interest in solving machine learning problems for healthcare.\n\u2022 Experience or interest in working with multidisciplinary teams that include scientists, engineers, and statisticians. B.S. (advanced preferred) or related degree in a quantitative discipline. Able to come into either our San Francisco or Boston office two to three days a week.\n\nBenefits & Perks\n\nWe offer a suite of benefits and perks for our team members, including:\n\n\u2022 Company-subsidized medical, dental, & vision insurance plans\n\n\u2022 401k plan with generous company matching\n\n\u2022 Flexible PTO plus company holidays\n\n\u2022 Annual company-wide winter break (December 24 - January 1)\n\n\u2022 Professional development budget to attend conferences or other events\n\n\u2022 One-time home-office set up stipend\n\n\u2022 Commuter benefits plan\n\n\u2022 Paid Parental Leave\n\n\u2022 Equity education and tax advisory service\n\nUnlearn is an equal opportunity employer.\n\nAt Unlearn, we are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workplace, because inclusion and diversity are essential to achieving our mission. If you\u2019re excited about this role, and your past experience doesn\u2019t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply nevertheless.\n\nUnlearn.AI focuses on Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Clinical Trials. Their company has offices in San Francisco. They have a small team that's between 11-50 employees. To date, Unlearn.AI has raised $4.85M of funding; their latest round was closed on March 2019.\n\nYou can view their website at http://www.unlearn.health or find them on Twitter and LinkedIn",

These models are used in our patient and physician-facing product features and developed in collaboration with our clinical innovation, research, engineering, and design teams.\n\n\u2022Design offline and online evaluations to test ML product features, and perform data-driven analysis of the results to find actionable insights.\n\nEnable rapid and rigorous scientific innovation by a multidisciplinary team of Curai clinicians, engineers, and researchers, through platform, tools, and documentation.\n\n\u2022Participate in interviewing diverse talent to build and grow a strong ML engineering team.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Need\n\n\u2022\u201cEnd-to-end\u201d experience building ML production systems: Along with strong ML fundamentals, you will need exposure to the entire lifecycle of machine learning production systems, such as data processing, modeling, deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and improving the models over time using feedback loops.\n\n\u2022Experience in natural language processing applications\n\n\u2022\"Product sense\" or intuition on what to build: With guidance, you will need to be able to translate product intuition into data-driven hypotheses that result in impactful machine learning/engineering solutions.\n\n\u2022Strong communication skills: This role involves collaboration with product, engineering, clinical, and research teams. Understanding the mental models of the audience and communicating ideas crisply to this diverse set of stakeholders will be a vital part of the role. You should be comfortable leading cross-functional machine learning product initiatives, from conception to successful product outcomes.\n\n\u20222+ years of industry experience in ML/NLP including building production systems.\n\nThe annual base salary range for this position is between $150,000 - $200,000. Stock grants also play a key part in any offer, they increase your overall compensation package significantly based on company success. Please note that the base salary range is a guideline, and individual total compensation will vary based on factors such as qualifications, skill level, competencies, and work location.\n\nWhat We Offer\n\nCulture: Mission driven talent with great colleagues committed to embodying our values, collaborating closely, and driving performance\n\nWellness: Unlimited PTO, flexible working hours, and remote working options\n\nBenefits: Excellent medical, dental, vision, flex spending plans, and paid parental leave\n\nFinancial: 401k plan with employer matching\n\nCurai Health is a startup with a small, but world-class team from high tech companies, AI researchers, practicing physicians, to team members from non-traditional career paths and backgrounds. We also have research partnerships with leading universities across the country and access to medical data that facilitates research in this space. We are a highly collaborative, data-driven team, focused on delivering our mission with funding from top-tier Silicon Valley investors including Morningside, General Catalyst, and Khosla Ventures.\n\nAt Curai Health, we are highly committed to building a diverse and inclusive environment.
