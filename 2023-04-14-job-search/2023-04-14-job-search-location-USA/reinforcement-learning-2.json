To us, entering the Arena means committing oneself fully and accepting the risk of failure in the pursuit of an audacious, worthy cause.\n\u2022 We\u2019re a close-knit tribe of scientists and builders exploring the boundaries of how artificial intelligence can... benefit humanity. If you share our passion for delving deep into real-world problems and solving them with fully autonomous AI, join us in the Arena.\n\nWhat we do:\n\u2022 Arena empowers businesses across industries to make high frequency, critical path decisions fully autonomous. Our products have helped some of the world\u2019s largest CPG companies transform their sales and supply chains into increasingly autonomous, self-learning systems \u2014 unlocking efficiencies and resulting in better, more affordable consumer experiences.\n\u2022 But autonomous selling is just the beginning. Arena knows that Autonomy can help organizations tackle much more, from delivering critical goods and services more affordably, sustainably, and equitably to the world, to reducing green premiums on renewable energy to compete more effectively with fossil fuels.\n\nHow you will contribute:\n\nAs a Machine Learning Scientist at Arena, your responsibilities will include developing machine learning systems that leverage uncertainty estimation and active learning approaches like Reinforcement Learning to solve real-world problems faced by our customers. Your work will span the spectrum from quick exploratory/experimental models to scaled, production processes.\n\nYour work may start from simple models, but the ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of what is scientifically and technically possible, and share those advances with the greater scientific community via publication and/or open source.\n\nRequired qualifications:\n\u2022 Working full time in our office in NYC\n\u2022 Deep passion for AI and building machine learning systems\n\u2022 Interested in the full ML stack from initial R&D through deploying models into production\n\u2022 Comfortable working with data in Python and SQL\n\u2022 Passionate about good engineering, clean code, and scalability\n\u2022 Able to communicate technical concepts clearly at all levels, whether that be engaging deeply on a topic with other Machine Learning Scientists or sharing key insights with business stakeholders\n\nIt would be great if you have:\n\u2022 Experience with active learning, reinforcement learning, causal inference and/or online learning approaches\n\u2022 Experience with serverless or highly distributed Machine Learning model training on massive datasets\n\u2022 Expertise in experimental design and Bayesian uncertainty estimation\n\u2022 Familiarity in deep learning frameworks (e.g. PyTorch/TensorFlow)\n\nBenefits:\n\u2022 99% of the monthly premium for Aetna medical insurance, plus vision and dental coverage\n\u2022 401(k) Retirement Plan\n\u2022 Unlimited PTO\n\u2022 Laptop and monitor of your choice\n\u2022 Office supplies stipend\n\u2022 Ramp Company Card\n\u2022 Continued education allowance (books, e-courses)\n\u2022 Attendances to top conferences in their fields\n\u2022 Lunch every day (and at company wide events)\n\u2022 Snack and self-serve lunch options\n\u2022 Global WeWork membership\n\nBase Salary Range: $160,000 - $200,000",
