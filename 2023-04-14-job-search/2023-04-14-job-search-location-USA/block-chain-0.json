In today's blockchain ecosystem, each service is typically secured by its own token. The difficulty of bootstrapping new tokens often leads to too little capital to secure their services... sufficiently. With EigenLayer, blockchain services can rely on Ethereum for security instead of the value of their own token values. Stakers in the Ethereum proof-of-stake network can \"re-stake\" their assets with EigenLayer to secure other services and earn higher returns. Customers pay transaction fees for these strong security guarantees, making it possible for anyone to build innovative blockchain modules without large upfront capital costs.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe are seeking a highly skilled and experienced Blockchain Security Lead to join our blockchain technology team. As the functional lead of security for EigenLayer, you will be responsible for developing and implementing robust security measures to protect our blockchain and smart contracts infrastructure against potential threats. You will be leading initiatives to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of our blockchain infrastructure.\n\nThis is a full-time position that is fully remote or located with the team based in Seattle.\n\nIn order to do this work effectively, you will need to:\n\u2022 Develop and implement security policies, procedures, and standards to protect our smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure.\n\u2022 Conduct internal security assessments, audits, and vulnerability testing to identify potential security risks and mitigate them.\n\u2022 Collaborate with other teams to ensure the security of the entire EigenLayer ecosystem, including on-chain smart contracts, off-chain nodes, validation infrastructure and wallets.\n\u2022 Develop and maintain incident response plans to handle security breaches and other security incidents.\n\u2022 Contribute to internal and external tooling as part of our effort to make smart contract programming safer and more maintainable.\n\u2022 Stay up-to-date with the latest security trends and developments in the blockchain industry, and continuously improve the security best practices.\n\u2022 Engage with the community as a thought-leader for suggesting best-practices of security for various participants in the EigenLayer ecosystem.\n\nAbout You\n\u2022 Bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science, Information Security, or a related field.\n\u2022 5+ years of experience in information security, with a focus on blockchain technology.\n\u2022 3+ years experience in software development using Golang, C++, Rust, etc.\n\u2022 Experience leading large-scale security programs either within an organization or across one or more user communities\n\u2022 Solid understanding of blockchain architecture, including consensus algorithms, smart contracts, and node management.\n\u2022 Strong experience with cyber-security tools such as penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and intrusion detection/prevention systems.\n\u2022 Strong experience in Web3 security, including smart-contract audits, formal verification, validator node management, wallet security, and key management.\n\u2022 Excellent written, and verbal communication skills.\n\u2022 Ability to collaborate with cross-functional and geographically remote teams, partners, and community members.\n\nBonus Points\n\u2022 Strong leadership skills with experience managing a team of security professionals.\n\nYou enjoy contributing in a team environment\n\u2022 Proficient and thoughtful with asynchronous and synchronous communication, giving and receiving feedback, and working independently and with a team\n\u2022 Proactively contribute to discussions about technical issues, sprint and roadmap planning, and improving team processes\n\nYou want to help the crypto ecosystem improve the everyday lives of billions\n\u2022 Excited to learn and develop blockchain technology, even if you don\u2019t have crypto development experience yet.\n\u2022 Recognize the culture and community in crypto are different from other professional software industries, and you want to embrace and improve it",

Cryptops is currently... the only decentralized exchange that uses asset tokenization to issue traditional financial derivatives directly to an on-blockchain order book.\n\nOther decentralized derivatives exchanges require users to install web browser plugins in order to \"connect\" to a hybrid off-chain order book to place orders and make trades. This insecure method causes users to constantly lose millions in various \"hacks\", \"exploits\" and \"vulnerabilities\". These problems are solved using Cryptops where trades happen directly on the verifiable blockchain order book with transactions closing on average in under 5 seconds.\n\nSome unique benefits of the Cryptops project.\n\u2022 The most censorship resistant cryptocurrency derivatives DEX available.\n\u2022 The most secure and convenient staking model that does not involve any kind of obscure lending practices or lockups.\n\u2022 The asset token derivatives are exercisable to tokens that are pegged in value and directly transferable to real world native coins on their blockchains.\n\nFor further information, please visit the Cryptops website at: cryptops.exchange\n\nResponsibilities\n\nRaising capital, team building, and scaling the project.\n\nProviding overall strategic direction and take part in decisions on how to best advance the project such as to list the COE coin to centralized exchanges.\n\nPossessing strong understanding of the current DeFi market solutions and limitations.\n\nDeveloping and executing a plan to ensure the launch and growth of the Cryptops project. This will include leading fundraising efforts and managing relationships with investors.\n\nQualifications\n\nCan personally invest or immediately support an initial capital raise of $500,000 in return for a 10% ownership share of the Cryptops project.\n\nEntrepreneur interested in introducing an innovative DeFi platform that uses a direct access blockchain order book.\n\nAble to perform a seed funding of round of $300k to $3 million that will be used to get the project production ready and provide the proof of asset reserves that will be displayed by the public facing dashboard.\n\nDeep network of investors, technologist and blockchain enthusiasts",
